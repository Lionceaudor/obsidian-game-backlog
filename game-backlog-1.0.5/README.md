A video game backlog manager plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with automatic metadata fetching from IGDB, HowLongToBeat, and SteamGridDB.

## About This Project

This is a personal project I vibe coded for myself using [Mistral Vibe](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe) and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). The goal is simple: have an easy way to add games to my backlog, pick what to play next, and jot down notes about them after the fact.

The methodology is loosely inspired by [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgAlnDIPMU) about tackling gaming backlogs. The key insight is the "Value" score: rating ÷ hours to beat. This surfaces short, highly-rated games you can actually finish, rather than endlessly scrolling through a Steam library wondering what to commit to. I am not really one for spreadsheets so I thought I would give it a crack using Obsidian.

## Features

- **Game Search**: Search and add games to your backlog using the IGDB database
- **Automatic Metadata**: Fetches ratings, completion times, cover art, and more
- **Value Score**: Calculates rating ÷ HLTB hours, surfacing short, highly-rated games. A 90-rated 10-hour game (9.0) beats an 85-rated 40-hour game (2.1)
- **Dataview Dashboard**: Auto-generated dashboard with games organized by priority and platform
- **Status Tracking**: Track games as "Must Play", "Playing", "Completed", or "Dropped"

Supported platforms include Full PC, Gaming Laptop, Steam Deck, Android Handheld and Nintendo Switch.
